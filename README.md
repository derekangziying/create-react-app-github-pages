## React Deployment to Github Pages & Workflow Demo

This project aims to deploy the basic create-react-app onto github pages.

https://derekangziying.github.io/create-react-app-github-pages/

A workflow with github actions was also created to auto deploy (no more manual deployment) upon a push execution for the react app.

Workflow Idea: push to master, run deploy, update custom domain (the link above).
